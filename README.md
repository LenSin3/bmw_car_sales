## Background

BMW is one of the best luxury car brands and it is considered a status symbol around the world. A brand new BMW, for example a **740i/750i xDrive** Model will cost a minimum of $86,000 USD. As you can see, not everyone is cut out to spend that much on a car. Second hand or used vehicles are the go to choice for most people who cannot afford the cost of a new car.

In the light of the above, this project will use Supervised Machine Learning to predict the price of a used BMW car. 

## Method

The project will follow the below:

- Read data.
- Data validation and profiling.
- Data transformation.
- exploratory data analysis.
- Machine Learning model developmenmt.
- Feature importances.

## Data

The data used in this project is obtained from [Datacamp's Career Hub repository](https://github.com/datacamp/careerhub-data) on GitHub.
